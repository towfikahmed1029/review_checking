Review
"This is my first experience with this type of product, so I don't know if my technique needs improvement. This worked very well on surfaces inside my house, the fine gray house dust just went away with a quick press and remove of this product. In my wife's car, it didn't seem to have enough stickiness to pull away the lint and dust. I suspect that some type of sealer for the plastic surfaces may have been used when she had the car detailed a while back. I remember just a few days after the detailing, there was a sticky feel to the dashboard and other interior surfaces. Even blue painters tape couldn't pull away the dust however, so it's not the fault of this product. So be aware it may not work on some surfaces that have been treated with ""sealers""."
